## Project: Recursion

### Assignment
1. Build a function mergeSort that takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology.
2. Tips:
* Think about what the base case is and what behavior is happening again and again and can actually be delegated to someone else (e.g. that same function!).
* It may be helpful to check out the background videos again if you donâ€™t quite understand what should be going on.
